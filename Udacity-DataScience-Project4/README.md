# Sparkify: Predict Music Churn withÂ Pyspark

## Installations
 - NumPy
 - Pandas
 - Seaborn
 - Matplotlib
 - PySpark SQL
 - PySpark ML 

## Project Motivation
This project is to build some models to predict if a user would be churned and this work was done with Pyspark.

The project involved:
 - Load mini JSON dataset file, clean data.
 - Perform explanatory data analysis, define churn and try to determine features that will be used in the model.
 - Define features that will be used in the model while predicting churn.
 - Select two models which are Random Forest and NaiveBayees to compare the results

## File Descriptions
There is one exploratory notebook and html file of the notebook available here to showcase my work in predicting churn. Markdown cells were used throughout to explain the process taken.

## Medium Blog Post 
The main findings of the code can be found at the Medium Blog post available [here](https://medium.com/@nguyenthuytuongvi56/predict-music-churn-with-pyspark-be19b23f1010) explaining the technical details of my project.
A Random Forest Classifier was chosen to be the best model by evaluating F1 score and accuracy metrics. The final model achieved an F1 and Accuracy score of 0.7.
